# README
ðŸ‘‹Hello, everyone! My name is Yevgieniia. I'm a student currently studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This repository is where I'll be storing my lab assignments and projects related to OOP and more. Feel free to explore or contribute!

## OOP Labs

This repository contains a collection of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab assignments, focusing on foundational OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and design patterns. Additionally, I'm learning to work with frameworks like .NET MAUI for cross-platform development and ASP.NET for web applications.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio
- .NET SDK for C# development

## Project Structure
- **Lab1/** -
- **Lab2/** -
- Frameworks/ - Projects exploring .NET MAUI and ASP.NET

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the desired lab project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Compile and run the code to explore examples and solutions.
